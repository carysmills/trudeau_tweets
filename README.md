# trudeau_tweets [WIP]

A **work in progress** Python program that visualizes the number of times a specific word was tweeted by Justin Trudeau per month, compared to overall tweet volume.

The black line on the chart represents the number of tweets per month. The blue line is the number of times the given word appeared in the tweets.
